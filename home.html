<h2 id="home">Artifical Intelligence And Data Science</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (AI & DS) is an advanced branch of computer science that focuses on creating
    intelligent systems and extracting meaningful information from data. Artificial Intelligence enables machines to
    mimic human intelligence by learning, reasoning, and making decisions, while Data Science involves collecting,
    processing, analyzing, and interpreting large amounts of data to solve real-world problems. AI & DS uses concepts
    from programming, mathematics, statistics, and machine learning to build smart applications such as chatbots,
    recommendation systems, facial recognition, medical diagnosis systems, and predictive analytics. This field has wide
    applications in healthcare, banking, education, agriculture, e-commerce, and many other industries. Due to its
    growing demand and future scope, AI & DS offers excellent career opportunities such as Data Scientist, AI Engineer,
    Machine Learning Engineer, and Data Analyst, making it one of the most promising and in-demand fields today.</p>
